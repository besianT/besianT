Hello everyone, my name is Besian Tahiri, and I love programming. My programming journey began in high school. I went to a technical high school with a major in electronics and telecommunications where I learned about circuits, radios, televisions, and much more. During my first year I had my first programming class in C++, and here is where I became very interested in CS and what led me to pursue a CS major in UIC.

Currently, I am studying hard as a third year student where I am advancing my programming knowledge in areas such as coding in assembly, trees, graphs, maps, etc. I am also working on some video game projects in C++ at home. I also plan on focusing on my AI theory as I wish to work as an AI developer in the future. The reason for this is I always found AI fascinating, and I think that AI can change the world.

MY SKILLS:
languages: C, C++, Python, Java
Operating systems: Windows, Linux, IOS
